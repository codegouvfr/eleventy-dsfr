        <p class="fr-text--lg">
          The <code>BlueHats</code> are all the people who want to show that they contribute to Free and Open Source
          software developed and/or used by public administrations <strong>all over the world</strong>: civil servants
          involved in the use and development of these software, of course, but also citizens who recognise that their
          actions in favour of Free Software help the administration's projects.
        </p>
        <p class="fr-text--lg">
          <code>BlueHats</code> is <em>not</em> a product or a brand of the French Free Software Unit. It's a global
          movement to which our unit contributes by publishing a <a href="/fr/bluehats/tags/gazette/">newsletter in
            French</a>, organising <a href="/fr/bluehats/tags/atelier/">online workshops</a> and <a
              href="/fr/bluehats/tags/rencontre/">face-to-face meetings</a>. All public administrations around the world
          are invited to contribute to this movement and add events to the
          <a target="new" href="https://bluehats.global/about/">bluehats.global</a> website!

        <h3><code>BlueHats</code> events</h3>
        <p class="fr-text--lg">
          You can start by organising <code>BlueHats</code> events, inviting people to support Free Software in the
          public sector by sharing their expertise, hacking, etc. Events do not have to be big hackathons: even small
          face-to-face meetings are useful.
        </p>
        <h3><code>BlueHats</code> online workshops</h3>
        <p class="fr-text--lg">
          As a civil servant, you can easily share your expertise on Free Software through online workshops to which you
          can invite other civil servants.
        </p>
        <h3><code>BlueHats</code> newsletters</h3>
        <p class="fr-text--lg">
          If your administration is willing to commit to spreading information about the progress of Free Software in
          the public sector, it can publish a newsletter.
